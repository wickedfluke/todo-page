# todo-page
TodoPage created with Express and Angular

## Status: completed
The project is working and running as intended

## Bonus missings
- Hide todos when checked as completed

~~- [Modal](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/components/modal/examples) as component and not writed into page's html~~ See [updates](https://github.com/wickedfluke/todo-page/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#updates)

- In the assign option on todo component, the name of the user that have already the todo assigned to himself shouldn't be visible

- The date sort for the todos should be done with [aggregate](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/)

## Updates

- After converting the modal into a component, the adding service does not show result immediately but it needs a refresh, so I kept the actual version
